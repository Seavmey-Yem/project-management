<body>
    To successfully manage a project, you need a well-organized list of tasks. A clear list helps you prioritize your goals, track progress, and stay on schedule. Without proper management, things can quickly become chaotic. Whether it's a to-do list, a task list, or a priority list, having structure makes all the difference.
